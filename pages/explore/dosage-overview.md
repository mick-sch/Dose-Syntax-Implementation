CareConnect medication profiles contain a dosageInstruction elemnet that uses the HL7 FHIR STU3 [Dosage](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/dosage.html#Dosage) structure. 

Combinations of the data elements are used to describe a dosage instruction or dosage appropriate for medicines dispensing and/or administration. 

This section specifies preferred patterns of element use to consistently record dosage instructions.
