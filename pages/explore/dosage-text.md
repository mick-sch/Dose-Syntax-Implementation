To support backwards compatibility, the **text** attribute must be populated with a medically equivalent human readable textual representation of the structured dosage instruction.

At the time of writing, implementation guidance is to use the existing textual dosage instruction within this field.

An updated version of this guidance may define a logical sequence to generate a human readable dose string from the components of the Dosage structure.
