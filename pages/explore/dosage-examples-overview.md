These examples are not complete with respect to all mandatory or required data for a CareConnect implementation but instead highlight the variety of use of the FHIR Dosage structure.

Examples are split into three categories;
  * Simple
  * Intermediate
  * Complex

For simplicity, all examples are modelled with medication information within a referenced contained resource, opposed to referencing a medication resource defined elsewhere within a Bundle.
