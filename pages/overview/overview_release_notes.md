## 2.1.0-alpha ##
This is the second version published using Jekyll.

The following Profiles are tightly constrained XXXXXXXXXXXXXX3 replacements of the corresponding Care Connect Profiles:

- CareConnect-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-Header-Practitioner-1 replaces CareConnect-Practitioner-1
- CareConnect-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-Header-PractitionerRole-1 replaces CareConnect-PractitionerRole-1
- CareConnect-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-Header-Organization-1 replaces CareConnect-Organization-1

The following Profiles have changed for this release:

- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageHeader-2: the slicing on the event data element has been removed, and now this is bound to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageEvent-2 value set.
- Extension-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageHandling-2: this has been restructured because the handling keys have been reviewed and updated following a decision to move to MESH, where redundant keys have been removed and additional keys added, see the [Handling Specification Section](explore_hand_spec.html) for further details.  In the previous version of this Profile this was structured as Key data element containing a valueCodeableConcept and a value.  In this version, each handling key is represented by its own extension URL element, containing the appropriate allowable value.

This value set has changed:

- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageEvent-2 - the value of the system element has changed to "https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageEvent-2".

This value set has been removed:

- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-HandlingKey-1 - this is no longer needed, as the Handling Key information is modelled as a complex extension which consists of an Extension URL that carries the Handling Key and an associated allowable value in the Extension-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageHandling-2 Profile.  See the [Handling Specification Section](explore_hand_spec.html) for further details".

This code system has changed:

- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageEvent-2: there are new code values for eDischarge, Mental Health eDischarge, Emergency Care eDischarge and Outpatient Letter.

This code system has been removed:

- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-HandlingKey-1: this is no longer needed due to the way that the handling key information is modelled in the Extension-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-MessageHandling-2 Profile

The XML Examples have been updated to reflect the changes outlined above.

## 2.0.0-alpha.0 ##
First version published using Jekyll.
